# Internet

## How does the internet work?

**Internet** ⇒ The physical thing that do every work

**World Wide Web (WWW)** ⇒ The internet protocol

**Backbones** ⇒ They are the mangment request networks, they receive or send requests. 

**TCP/IP** ⇒ Tecnology that makes connection between two locals networks.

**Is it possible to tear down the internet?** In the theory, yes! But in the real, no. Because, if someone destroyed some equipments, the signal can bypass this place. And in attack software programs cases, the architecture can be protecting and isolate the attack.

**Overview (steps):** 

- The starting point is the backbones, which distribute information across the network using TCP/IP technology to determine where the data should go.
- Then, the internet reaches the access providers, who contract the connection with the backbones and distribute it to the service providers.
- Service providers, in turn, distribute the connection to end users, for example, via fiber optics.
- Finally, the internet connection reaches end users' devices.

## What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?

The HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. 

**HTTP request include**: HTTP version type, a headers, an URL, an optional body, method (POST, GET etc.) 

**Extra**: The HTTP protocol is not very security, so we use HTTPS protocol.
That is the form of obtain more security, because is the join between HTTP protocol and SSL security protocol.
